USING LIGHTWEIGHT-SESSIONS                        *lightweight-sessions-using*

Lightweight sessions has two uses.

1. Allows you to easily save and load sessions information. The following
   keymaps are defined:

    "<Leader>ss": save a session.
    "<Leader>sl": load a session.
    "<Leader>sL": load a session and delete the session file.
    "<Leader>sc": choose a session from a list.
    "<Leader>sC": choose a session from a list and delete the session file.

   If a count is given, that count will be used as the session name. Otherwise,
   you will be asked for a session name, with the last session name being used
   as a default.


2. Allows you to quickly cd to defined directories and explore files there;
   this requires defining a dictionary of directory or file names keyed to a
   particular set of keys. (See |lightweight-sessions-configuring|.)

CONFIGURING LIGHTWEIGHT-SESSIONS            *lightweight-sessions-configuring*

The following variables can be configured (with defaults given):

|g:lws_directories|={}                             *g:lws_directories*
This is the dictionary of directories/files that lightweight sessions will
open. The dictionary key determines the keys to enter following the lightweight
sessions prefix to open the corresponding value. Values are specified as paths
to files or directories; they need not be escaped. For example:

    let g:lws_directories={"d": "~/Documents"}

will allow hitting "<Leader>sd" to cd to and view the ~/Documents directory in
netrw.

|g:lws_prefix|="<Leader>s"                              *g:lws_prefix*
This specifies the prefix to type before typing the relevant dictionary key.

|g:lws_list|="l"                                          *g:lws_open*
This specifies the key to use with the prefix to present a list of defined
key-file/directory pairs. You can then select one to open.

|g:lws-open-string|="123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"  *g:lws-open-string*
This specifies the string of characters to use for activating item in session
list.
